# Web Security Technical Assessment

## Context
Technical risk and vulnerability assessment performed against a fictional web application designed for security evaluation purposes.

## Scope
- External (black-box) analysis
- Vulnerability enumeration and detection
- No active exploitation
- No denial-of-service testing

## Methodology
- Domain and service reconnaissance
- Identification of exposed services
- Technology fingerprinting
- Detection of insecure configurations
- Risk assessment based on potential impact

## Key Findings
- Unnecessary exposure of critical services
- Outdated CMS components with known vulnerabilities
- User enumeration vectors
- Missing HTTP security headers

## Risk Analysis
The identified issues could enable unauthorized access, data exposure, and privilege escalation, affecting system confidentiality and integrity.

## Recommendations
- Reduce attack surface
- Restrict access to critical services
- Keep components up to date
- Implement HTTP security headers
- Strengthen authentication and input validation

## Key Learnings
- Risk prioritization based on impact
- Importance of scope and ethical testing
- Clear communication of technical findings
